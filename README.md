# Google-Clone-with-php-and-mysql
Before you can use it,make sure your php version is upto date and make sure you have a funtioning web server like xampp or wampp.

1.extract the zip file and upload them to your web server directory.usually htdocs.

2.you will need to create a database named "googleclone"

3.in the database folder import the sql file and you are good to go.

4.
I have already crawl some websites and so you can also test it out and have fun.
Go to the file "crawl.php" and at th bottom you would find the url section.change the url to any website url you want to crawl.Save it and run it in your browser it will show you all the links that have been crawled and you can so your searching after this.
